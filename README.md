# Model Video Comparison Tool

This tool provides a user-friendly interface for comparing video outputs generated by different machine learning models. Users can select an ID and models to view corresponding videos side-by-side, enabling effective model evaluation and selection.

## Features

- **ID Selection**: Choose a specific ID to load related video prompts and video comparisons.
- **Model Selection**: Select models to compare from a list of available models.
- **Video Synchronization**: Play multiple videos simultaneously for side-by-side comparison.
- **Dynamic Video Loading**: Automatically loads and displays videos based on the selected ID and chosen models.

## Requirements

- **Python** 3.8+
- **Gradio** for the interface
- **Pandas** for data manipulation

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ModelVideoComparisonTool.git
   cd ModelVideoComparisonTool
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install gradio pandas
   ```

3. Place `video_data.csv` and `all_models.py` in the root directory. `video_data.csv` should contain the video paths and `all_models.py` should define the list of model names.

## Usage

1. Start the application by running:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open the Gradio interface in your browser using the URL provided in the console.

3. **How to Use the Interface**:
   - **ID Selector**: Use the dropdown to select an ID, which loads the prompt and corresponding videos for that ID.
   - **Model Selection**: Select models to view and compare their videos.
   - **Sync Play Button**: Click this button to play all loaded videos in sync for a smoother comparison experience.

## File Structure

- **`app.py`**: Main file for launching the Gradio interface.
- **`video_data.csv`**: A CSV file containing video data. The file should have the following structure:
  - Columns: `ID`, `Text Prompt`, and one column for each model containing the video file path for that model.
- **`all_models.py`**: A Python file containing a list of model names, which should match the columns in `video_data.csv`.

## Example of `video_data.csv`

The CSV file should look like this:

| ID       | Text Prompt               | Model_A              | Model_B              | Model_C              |
|----------|----------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| ID_001   | "Example Prompt for ID 1"  | path/to/videoA.mp4   | path/to/videoB.mp4   | path/to/videoC.mp4   |
| ID_002   | "Example Prompt for ID 2"  | path/to/videoA2.mp4  | path/to/videoB2.mp4  | path/to/videoC2.mp4  |

Each row corresponds to an ID, with columns for a text prompt and video paths for each model.

## Troubleshooting

- **Videos not loading initially**: Ensure `video_data.csv` is correctly formatted and video paths are valid.
- **JavaScript Injection Fails**: If the sync play button fails, ensure the JavaScript in `head` is properly set, and try increasing the timeout for JavaScript execution in `app.py`.
